<h1>Learning basic HTML</h1>
<p> 
I am learning basic HTML through VS Code program. This is a great program to learn coding. 
It helps write HTML code, CSS, JavaScript, and much more. Another great program to use is CodeCademy.
I have been using that program and learning step by step helping me advance my coding skills, 
and learn new coding languages.

<h2>My background and who I am</h2>
<p>
My name is Nadeem, and I was born in India, I currently live in Canada. The reason why I chose to learn 
coding is because I have always been interested in creating webpages, applications, and working on social media.
Software development is fun because it is like making a puzzle, and each line of code is a small piece of the puzzle.
When the puzzle is finished you see the full finished picture and see how great it is. Each line of code has it's own purpose
and that is cool and see that it actually works as intended on a website, app, or anything digital.
